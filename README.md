Hello
For the program to run I am assuming that you have followed all the instructions given in the gfg link
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-mysql-database-in-visual-studio-2022-for-a-cpp-application/

To run the program you need to open the assignment1 folder and inside that open the Project1.sln file.

A Visual Studio window will open wherein you will have to enter your MySQL username and password on line 684.

Then you need to click on the play button present on the right side of "Local Windows Debugger".

A window will open where you can start operating the program by first clicking on the terminal and then
following the instructions on screen. 

You can go back in the program by pressing b.

There is only one manager. Password is lmao_ded 
There are customers with customer id 1,2,3,4,5
Their passwords are Password1, Password2, Password3, Password4, Password5
Similarly for employees.

You can contact me via email: nsrujan22@iitk.ac.in if you find any trouble running the program.
As this is my first time running an sql based program, I hope you contact me in case any issues are found.

Regards,
