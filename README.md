# Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. **Open Project**: Navigate to the `Assignment1` folder and open the `Project1.sln` file. 
2. **Setup MySQL Database**: Ensure you've followed the instructions provided in the [GeeksforGeeks link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-setup-mysql-database-in-visual-studio-2022-for-a-cpp-application/). To run the code on my PC, I had made changes in the required places according to my downloaded folder location. You will have to make changes according to the download location of your MySQL connector package.

3. **Enter MySQL Credentials**: In Visual Studio, locate line 684 in the code and enter your MySQL username and password.

4. **Run the Program**: Click on the play button on the right of ("Local Windows Debugger") to execute the program.

5. **Operating the Program**: Once the program window opens, interact with it by following the on-screen instructions. Use the terminal and navigate back by pressing `b`.
